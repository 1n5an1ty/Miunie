ü§† **Wanna help?** Checkout the [contributing section](#contributing).

üë©‚Äçüíª **Wanna try it out?** See the [getting started guide](#getting-started).

üêõ **Found a bug?** Let us know by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/discord-bot-tutorial/Miunie/issues/new).

üí° **Have an idea/suggestion?** Tell us all about it through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/discord-bot-tutorial/Miunie/issues/new).

## Getting Started

These instructions are going to walk you through downloading a copy of Miunie and running it.

> üîß If you want to know how to setup your environment for development, see [this guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-development-environment).

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout our [deployment section](#deployment) for notes on how to set the project up for hosting on a dedicated machine.

## Prerequisites

- **IDE / Code Editor**

For picking which IDE to use, take a look at the following table.

* ‚≠ê - Recommended for a given platform
* ‚ö† - Known issues for a given platform
* ‚úÖ - Will work for a given platform

> _If you are a beginner, we suggest sticking to the ‚≠ê recommended options._

|                   | Miunie.ConsoleApp | Miunie.WindowsApp | Miunie.AspNet |
|-------------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|--------------:|
| [Visual Studio **2019** (Community)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)| ‚≠ê | ‚≠ê | ‚≠ê |
| [Visual Studio 2017 (Community)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)| ‚ö† | ‚ö† | ‚ö† |
| [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)                           | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ö†  |
| [Rider: The Cross-Platform .NET IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)         | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

- **Visual Studio Prerequisites**

During the installation process of Visual Studio, you should always include the following options:

![visual studio base dependencies](img/vsdeps-base.png)

If you would like to build the ASP.NET project, include the following option:

![visual studio asp dependencies](img/vsdeps-asp.png)

If you would like to build the Universal Windows Platform App, include the following option:

![visual studio UWP dependencies](img/vsdeps-win.png)

- **Ensuring .NET Core 2.2 (or higher) is installed**

To make sure you have the correct version of .NET Core, open your `command promt`/`Terminal`/`Powershell` and type in the following command:

```
dotnet --list-sdks
```

_Here is an example of this command's output on Windows:_

```
2.1.602 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
2.2.202 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
3.0.100-preview3-010431 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
```

Your output will most likely differ a bit.

If you see a version higher or equal to `2.2`, you can continue to the next step.

If you don't see the right version or if you got a response similar to `Command not found`, you need to download an install the latest version of .NET Core.

You can install it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

- **Getting a copy of the project**

> If you want to clone or fork this repository instead, please follow the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Download the project by pressing the green "Clone or download" button and selecting the "Download ZIP" option.

![GitHub download repo](img/github-download.png)

Unzip the directory and navigate into the `src` folder inside it.

Open the `Miunie.sln` in your IDE.

üéâ Congratulations, you are now set up for building and running Miunie.

If you need more information about how to build and run the project, please contact us on our Discord server:

</a>

## Installation

This is a step by step guide to get Miunie up and running on your machine.

1. [Get the source code](#getting-the-source)
2. [Setup your IDE](#setting-up-the-environment---visual-studio-ide)
3. [Setup a bot token](#setting-up-a-bot-token)

### Getting the source

1. [Fork The Original Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. Navigate to your fork.
3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork to your local machine.

### Setting up the environment - Visual Studio IDE

- The root directory of the project contains Miunie.sln, this is a solution file and you can open it with Visual Studio (See [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites))
- Once Visual Studio is open, you should try to [build the solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/building-and-cleaning-projects-and-solutions-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2017).
  - You can do so by using the shortcut `F6` or going to `Build` > `Build Solution`.
- If the build fails due to some kind of error, make sure to fix it before continuing with this guide.

### Setting up the environment - Visual Studio Code

- Open Visual Studio Code
- Open the project's `src` folder (the one with `Miunie.sln` in it) in Visual Studio Code.
- To build the application, open the [Integrated Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and type `dotnet build`.
- You should see the build succeeded with no errors.

### Setting up the environment - Rider IDE

- Open Rider IDE and on the "Welcome to JetBrains Rider" screen select the "Open Solution or Project" option.

![Open Solution or Project](https://i.imgur.com/BcDD0AQ.png)

- Navigate to your cloned Directory and select the `Miunie.sln` file.

- To build the project, navigate to `Build` > `Build Solution` or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>

### Setting up a bot token

The bot configuration is stored as an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) file.

When you compile Miunie, the project uses the configuration from `Miunie.ConsoleApp/App.config`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In a compiled project, the configuration file is called `Miunie.ConsoleApp.dll.config`.

The project comes with a configuration template: `Miunie.ConsoleApp/App.config.template`. To use the template:

- Create a copy of the `App.config.template` file.
- Rename it to `App.config`
- Open the file for editing
- Find the line with `key="DiscordToken"`
- Replace the `Your-Token-Here` placeholder with your bot's token.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Our repository is setup to ignore `App.config` to prevent you from accidentally committing your token into the repository.


## Running Tests

To run the unit tests already inclduded in the project follow the directions that are relevent to you.

- **Visual Studio IDE**
  - Either use the shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd> or go to `Test` > `Run` > `All Tests` 
  - Test output Example:
  
![Example Output Of Tests](https://i.gyazo.com/da85fac25967d0f740cfa7c91a2fb182.png)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can `Restore` > `Build` > `Test` via the CLI as shown below in Visual Studio Code setup.

- **Visual Studio Code**
  - Open your terminal application and navigate into the project's `src` directory.
  - `dotnet test [Name of any .Tests directory]` - This runs the unit tests for specific modules. You should see a completed output stating that all tests passed.

![Running Unit Tests in VSC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495545716773617676/558704760987844609/unknown.png)

- **Rider IDE**
  - To run the Project's unit tests, navigate to `Tests` > `Run Unit Tests`.
  - You should see the test results in a "Unit Tests" window:
