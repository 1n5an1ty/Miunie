## About

**Miunie** is a community Discord bot project.

The project's purpose is to connect people interested in 
[free and Open Source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) development, the 
[C# programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29), and/or 
[Discord's bot API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

> You might be familiar with the [Community-Bot](https://github.com/discord-bot-tutorial/Community-Discord-BOT). This project is a complete rework of Community-Bot that improves the overall architecture.

## Getting Started

These instructions cover how to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout our [deployment section](#deployment) for notes on how to set the project up for hosting on a dedicated machine.

## Prerequisites

- Your favorite IDE/Code Editor
  - [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15) - Ensure you have `.NET Core cross-platform development` installed.
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Ensure you have the extension: [C# For Visual Studio Code - Omnisharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
- The GIT CLI
  - [Git Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - This is going to be used to both setup and deploy the project.
- Dotnet Core
  - [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
  - Sometimes Dotnet Core 2.2 wont install by default. Use the link above to download then install it.

## Installation

This is a step by step guide to get Miunie ready on your machine and ready for development.

### Getting the source

1. [Fork The Original Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. Navigate to your fork.
3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork to your local machine.

### Setting up the environment - Visual Studio IDE

- The root directory of the project contains Miunie.sln, this is a Visual Studio solution file and you can open it with Visual Studio (See [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites))
- Once Visual Studio is open, you should try build the project.
  - Either use the shortcut `F6` or goto `Build` > `Build Solution`
- The build should complete with any erorrs. Now you can run the unit tests.
  - Either use the shortcut `CTRL+R, A` or goto `Test` > `Run` > `All Tests` [Example Output Of Tests](https://i.gyazo.com/da85fac25967d0f740cfa7c91a2fb182.png)
- **NOTE**: You can `Restore` > `Build` > `Test` via the CLI as shown below in Visual Studio Code setup below if you wish.

### Setting up the environment - Visual Studio Code

- Go to the location on your PC where you cloned the forked repository to. [Example](https://i.gyazo.com/57b6aecdb110529c7e61cee7db5b0757.png)
- Click on the folder named `src` right click on the whitespace and click `Git Bash Here`. [Example](https://i.gyazo.com/57f3233e7ca1a488fbdef8a855a750f9.png)
- The Git Terminal should now be open. Run the following commands in this specific order.
  - `dotnet restore` - Restores the project dependencies & Nuget Packages.
  - `dotnet build` - Ensures your clone of the repo is complete by ensuring the project builds. You should see the build succeeded with no warnings or errors.
  - `dotnet test` - This runs the unit tests for the project. You should see a completed output stating that all tests passed.
- Now we know that the project was forked and cloned correctly, you can type `code .` to open Visual Studio Code in that directory and get started on your project.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests already inclduded in the project follow the directions that are relevent to you.

- Visual Studio IDE
  - Either use the shortcut `CTRL+R, A` or goto `Test` > `Run` > `All Tests` [Example Output Of Tests](https://i.gyazo.com/da85fac25967d0f740cfa7c91a2fb182.png)
- Visual Studio Code
  - `dotnet test` - From the terminal. Ensure you're in the working directory of the bot (The one that has Miunie.sln).
