## About

**Miunie** is a community Discord bot project.

The project's purpose is to connect people interested in 
[free and Open Source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) development, the 
[C# programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29), and/or 
[Discord's bot API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

> You might be familiar with the [Community-Bot](https://github.com/discord-bot-tutorial/Community-Discord-BOT). This project is a complete rework of Community-Bot that improves the overall architecture.

ü§† **Want to give us a hand? (doesn't have to be by writing code)** Have this cookie üç™ and read more about how exactly you can help in our [Contributing section](#contributing).

üë©‚Äçüíª **Just looking around?** Our [getting started guide](#getting-started) can get you up and running with your local Miunie in no-time.

üêõ **Found a bug?** Let us know by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/discord-bot-tutorial/Miunie/issues/new). If you are hardcore and can squash the bug yourself üò©üëå create the issue first, then create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).

üí° **Have an idea/suggestion?** Tell us all about it by creating a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/discord-bot-tutorial/Miunie/issues/new).

## Getting Started

These instructions cover how to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout our [deployment section](#deployment) for notes on how to set the project up for hosting on a dedicated machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Your favorite IDE/Code Editor**
  - [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15) - Ensure you have `.NET Core cross-platform development` installed.
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Ensure you have the extension: [C# For VSCode - Omnisharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
  - (recommended for GNU/Linux :penguin:) [Rider: The Cross-Platform .NET IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) from JetBrains
  - _Any other IDE/Code Editor you might want to use..._
- **The GIT CLI**
  - [Git Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - This is going to be used to both setup and deploy the project.
- **.NET Core**
  - [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (or newer)

> :warning: .NET Core does not always come with the VSC 2017 "Cross-platform dev" package.
>
> You can always install it yourself [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Installation

This is a step by step guide to get Miunie up and running on your machine.

### Getting the source

1. [Fork The Original Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. Navigate to your fork.
3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork to your local machine.

### Setting up the environment - Visual Studio IDE

- The root directory of the project contains Miunie.sln, this is a solution file and you can open it with Visual Studio (See [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites))
- Once Visual Studio is open, you should try to [build the solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/building-and-cleaning-projects-and-solutions-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2017).
  - You can do so by using the shortcut `F6` or going to `Build` > `Build Solution`.
- If the build fails due to some kind of error, make sure to fix it before continuing with this guide.

### Setting up the environment - Visual Studio Code

- Navigate to the cloned project's directory. _Should look similar to this:_

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/57b6aecdb110529c7e61cee7db5b0757.png)
- Open the `src` directory, then right click on the whitespace. From the context menu select `Git Bash Here`. _Should look similar to this:_

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/57f3233e7ca1a488fbdef8a855a750f9.png)
- The Git Terminal should now be open. Run the following commands in this specific order.
  - `dotnet restore` - Restores the project dependencies & Nuget Packages.
  - `dotnet build` - Ensures your clone of the repo is complete by ensuring the project builds. You should see the build succeeded with no errors.
- You can type `code .` to open Visual Studio Code in that directory and get started making your changes to the project.

### Setting up the environment - Rider IDE

- Open Rider IDE and on the "Welcome to JetBrains Rider" screen select the "Open Solution or Project" option.

![Open Solution or Project](https://i.imgur.com/BcDD0AQ.png)

- Navigate to your cloned Directory and select the `Miunie.sln` file.

- To build the project, navigate to `Build` > `Build Solution` or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests already inclduded in the project follow the directions that are relevent to you.

- **Visual Studio IDE**
  - Either use the shortcut `CTRL+R, A` or go to `Test` > `Run` > `All Tests` 
  - Test output Example:
  
![Example Output Of Tests](https://i.gyazo.com/da85fac25967d0f740cfa7c91a2fb182.png)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can `Restore` > `Build` > `Test` via the CLI as shown below in Visual Studio Code setup.

- **Visual Studio Code**
  - Open your terminal application and navigate into the project's `src` directory.
  - `dotnet test [Name of any .Tests directory]` - This runs the unit tests for specific modules. You should see a completed output stating that all tests passed.

- **Rider IDE**
  - To run the Project's unit tests, navigate to `Tests` > `Run Unit Tests`.
  - You should see the test results in a "Unit Tests" window:
